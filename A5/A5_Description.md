## Learning experience
In the beginning of the course we had some basic knowledge of python and BIM but did not know any advanced BIM concepts. Through the course and the assignments we developed our skills in BIM but also in python. We would categorize our selves in the "BIM Analyzer" group in the start of the course. During all the assignemnts we evolved to the "BIM Manager" by learning advanced BIM concepts and developing our python skills. Nevertheless we still can further develop our python skills as well as getting a deeper understanding of the BIM concepts so we could develop better tools. We would maybe use openBIM in our worklife after finishing our studies.

## Process of developing the tutorial
Using OpenBIM tools and programming are very interesting and developing a new tool could be a good project for the thesis. It was great that we could experience how to do it. If later for our thesis we also decide to develop some new OpenBIM tool, we have a good basis for it.  

Having a lot of freedom when choosing our focus area is at the same time positive and negative. It is much easier to do a task when we chose it, so we are interested in the topic. At the same time, it is hard to decide without any feedback if our project is fulfilling the criteria for the course or not. For this reason, it would be nice to have some more detailed examples, to see what kind of project we should work on. For the same reasons feedback from the teachers in the beginning of the semester would be very useful. Since the assignments are building to each other it is important to know if we are on the right track or not. 

Some more lectures on programming would be nice if we have to use it so much. 


## Recieved feedback on the tutorial
In general the feedback was about the installation part of our openBIM tool. Our code used a lot of packages which was an issue for the other group to install using the pip command. Besides that, they appreciated the 2D and 3D graphs viewing the results. So in general we would need to improve our installation guide.

## Future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
We will for now not use openBIM in our thesis. But the probability that we will use it in our career at one point is quite high.

## Wrap up
A1: We decided on our focus area being the structure and within that columns and beams. We learned which data can be found in the IFC model and where can we find it. 

[A2](/GitHub/DTU---Advanced-BIM-Assignment/A2/A2_Description.md): We probably spent the most time on this assignment. We learned how to use python coding to get different data out of an IFC file. We also realised that some important information about the columns’ and beams’ geometry is missing. Like the area of the section. Then we explored different methods to get this information. 

[A3](/GitHub/DTU---Advanced-BIM-Assignment/A3/A3_Description.md): We thought about the bigger picture, how could our tool be used for different engineers. We also described what else we would develop or advance further. We learned how to put new information into existing IFC models. 

[A4](/GitHub/DTU---Advanced-BIM-Assignment/A4/A4_Description.md): We made a tutorial for others on how to use our tool. This made us really think about the methods we used and the system how we built our code. 

[A5](/GitHub/DTU---Advanced-BIM-Assignment/A5/A5_Description.md): After our fellow students tested our tool, we can now see where the potential weaknesses are and which parts would need improvement.
